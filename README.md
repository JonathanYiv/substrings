# Enumerables Project

This is my version of implementing a [string searching algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_searching_algorithm).
It is a method that takes a string as an argument and an array of valid substrings as the second argument.
It returns a hash listing each substring and how many times it was found (as keys and values respectively).

This is a project from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/building-blocks).

## Installation

Open your Terminal/Command Line. Navigate to the directory where your version will live. Type in the following:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/JonathanYiv/substrings.git
$ cd substrings
$ substrings.rb
```

## Pre-Project Thoughts

This should be relatively easy.

## Post-Project Thoughts

It was relatively easy.
